Hello and thank you for trying out my pathtracer!
Needed Changes:
To get started you need to set yourself to DX12, go to the Edit Tab -> Project Settings -> Player -> Untick "Auto Graphics API For Windows" -> Click the little + Button that appears -> DirectX12 -> Drag the new DirectX12 to the top


To get started:
1. After importing the unity package, for a new scene you want to open the PathTracer tab on the top bar, and click "Arrange Hierarchy"(THIS WILL RE-ARRANGE YOUR HIERARCHY)
2. After doing this, your scene should now be in the format required by the pathtracer
3. Now you can click "Build Aggregated BVH" to build the acceleration structure for all objects, and just wait for the "All Objects Built" to turn green before entering play mode
4. After that is done, you can just enter play mode and play as normal


Important Notes:
1. If your camera is not tagged "Main Camera", you need to add the script "RenderHandle" to it manually
2. Objects cannot be marked with the static tag(this is due to them not being read/writeable when this is done, so I cant use them), truetrace will automatically turn this off on setup
3. Whenever you add objects to the scene, in order for them to be included in the pathtracer, you need to add the parent object/raytracing object, however I highly reccomend just pressing "Auto Assign Scripts" to automatically assign the scripts for you
4. Objects that will be spawned/despawned while in play mode(or in builds) that are to be included in the pathtracing must be read/write enabled, otherwise I cant read them at all
5. Meshes that are to move independantly need to either be a child of a gameobject with the "ParentObject" script or have a "ParentObject" script in the same gameobject


Structure Notes:
1. All objects that are to be raytraced must be under a gameobject with the "ParentObject" script or have this script on themselves, think of the parentobject as defining groups of meshes(its children with RayTracingObject scripts)
2. Meshes with RayTracingObject scripts will be raytraced


For an example scene, open up the DemoScene scene



Changable Defines:
To access the in script settings, go to the "GlobalDefines.cginc" under the TrueTrace/Resources folder
This will allow you to toggle some low level settings:
1. AdvancedAlphaMapped - This allows for cutout objects to be handled in the traversal stage, making them work
2. VideoIncludedInAlphaMapping - Same as above but allows this to be done to videos
3. ExtraSampleValidation - Allows an extra validation ray in ReSTIR GI for NEE rays
4. IgnoreGlassShadow - Allows direct rays to go through glass
5. IgnoreGlassMain - Same as above for main rays
6. DRP - This needs to be enabled if you are in HDRP
7. HardwareRT - This needs to be enabled if you want to use RT cores
8. PointFiltering - Disables stochastic texture sampling, basically turns off texture filtering
9. StainedGlassShadows - if IgnoreGlassShadow is on, this allows rays to be tinted by glass color
10. DX11 - Experiemental still, but will make it so you dont need DX12(needs to be paired with C# #define)

Pathtracer Settings Of Note:
Render Scale - Turning this down decreases the resolution we pathtrace at, and then upscales to the correct res(so turning to 0.5 will pathtrace at half resolution then upscale it)
Atmospheric Scattering Samples - How many passes of atmospheric scatter is computed(for multiple scattering), decrease this to 1 if you end up crashing when you try to play
